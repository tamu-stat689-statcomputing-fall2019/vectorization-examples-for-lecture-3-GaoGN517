# VectorizationExamples

**Example 1:** Square the elements of a vector

In this example, we will compare vectorized vs unvectorized code for squaring the elements of the vector. We will also see the performance of __apply__ family of functions.


**Example 2:** Classification in discriminant analysis

In this example, we will consider the classification rule in classical discriminant analysis, and see whether the rule can be vectorized for faster performance.
